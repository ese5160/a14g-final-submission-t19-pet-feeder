### Device Description

1. SG90 Servo Motor  
The servo motor is used to turn on and off the food storage. It is much more complicated and difficult than our expected when we implemented the drivers by ourselves. Since the rotation of the servo angle is controlled by the PWM signals which are generated by the TCC/TC timer counter, but not all MCU pins are attached with this function. Fortunately, the pin PA11 we assigned has the TCC1 counter. After the successful generation of the PWM signal, the next problem is how to verify the duty cycle after the system initialization. Once we changed the “compare_match” in the tcc_configure process, the whole system will get stuck and cashed. We solved it by using the “tcc_set_compare_value” function, where we can change the PWM length by calculating the required timer counter ticks based on the datasheet parameters.
